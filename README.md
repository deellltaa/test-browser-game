Title Pending for the game.

Created using Twine, with SugarCube.

Story will be based on Ambit's AGG-Like Gladiator Quest over in SpaceBattles. For fun!

Most of this will probably be structured poorly until I get into the groove of things.

If interested in playing as is (there is not much to even play!), download the index.html and run it. It should contain the things you need to actually play the game.
