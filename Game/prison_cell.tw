!Your Cell

<<nobr>>
    <<if $player.deaths gte 10>>
        The cell is as small as ever. You're not sure you miss this, but... it's where you are.
    <<else>>
        The cell is small and nearly suffocating.

There is a small window by a wall. <<nobr>>
<<if $time lte 390>>
    It's still dark outside. You can barely hear anything going on. People are either sleeping or being quiet.
<<elseif $time lte 480>>
    The light of the morning sun streams down into your prison cell, providing a modicum amount of 
    light into the place. You hear the early bustle of people moving about.
<<elseif $time lte 780>>
    Light streams down into your cell. The outside is loud. You hear a man scream instructions towards people, 
    and the sounds of equipment moving and a synchronized yell.
<<elseif $time lte 1140>>
    The sun has passed, and light isn't bearing down into your cell anymore. You hear the rumble of people conversing. 
    You hear equipment being moved and doors being closed. You wonder what's happening outside.
<<else>>
    Moonlight streams into your cell. It's not bright- it's almost calming, in fact. The night is calm, but you occasionally 
    hear other people break the stillness outside your cell.
